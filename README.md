# OpBNB/Place Smart Contract

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

# Deployed address

- opBNB testnet: `0xDB83AB530352D390c2C02b834fa8B303B2112Ca2``
- opBNB mainnet:
